# OCTO - CHIP-8 Emulator

A CHIP-8 emulator written in Rust as a learning project to explore low-level programming, emulation concepts, and Rust systems programming.

## Project Overview

CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language developed in the 1970s for simple video games. It was designed to run on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 microcomputers, but became popular for creating simple games due to its ease of implementation.

### Goals

- Build a fully functional CHIP-8 emulator from scratch
- Learn Rust systems programming concepts
- Understand emulation and virtual machine architecture
- Create a clean, well-documented codebase
- Support loading and running classic CHIP-8 ROMs

- [ ] Error handling for invalid ROMs
- [ ] File loading interface

### Phase 6: Testing and Compatibility (v0.6.0)

- [ ] Performance optimization

### Phase 7: Production Ready (v1.0.0)

- [ ] Enhanced debugging features
- [ ] Configuration options
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Installation and distribution
- [ ] Stable API and features

## Technical Decisions

### Dependencies

- **anyhow**: Error handling and context
- **clap**: CLI argument parsing
- **TBD**: Graphics library (considering `minifb`, `pixels`, or `macroquad`)
- **TBD**: Audio library (considering `rodio` or `cpal`)

### Architecture Choices

- **Modular design**: Separate modules for each major component
- **Trait-based interfaces**: Allow for different frontend implementations
- **Error handling**: Use `Result` types and proper error propagation
- **Testing**: Unit tests for each component, integration tests for ROM compatibility

### Performance Considerations

- Target 60Hz execution with accurate timing
- Efficient sprite drawing and collision detection
- Minimal allocations in the main emulation loop

## Controls (Planned)

CHIP-8 uses a 16-key keypad. Our keyboard mapping:

```
CHIP-8 Key    Keyboard
1 2 3 C       1 2 3 4
4 5 6 D  =>   Q W E R
7 8 9 E       A S D F
A 0 B F       Z X C V
```

## Version Management

We use a **Rust build script** (`build.rs`) for automatic version management and validation:

### Automatic Features

- **Build-time validation**: Warns if `Cargo.toml` version doesn't match git tags
- **Rich version info**: Git hash, branch, build time, dirty status automatically included
- **Cross-platform**: Pure Rust, no shell script dependencies
- **Cargo integration**: Rebuilds when git state changes

### Versioning Strategy

**v0.x.0 = Pre-release development**

- v0.1.0 = Project foundation (current)
- v0.2.0 = Core emulator working
- v0.3.0 = Display system
- v0.4.0 = Input and timing
- v0.5.0 = Audio and ROM loading
- v0.6.0 = Testing and compatibility
- v1.0.0 = Production ready

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Version info (shows current git-based version)
just version-detailed

# Development versions show commits since tag
# e.g., "0.1.0-dev.5" = 5 commits since v0.1.0

# Create a new release
just release minor    # 0.1.0 -> 0.2.0
just release patch    # 0.2.0 -> 0.2.1
just release major    # 0.6.0 -> 1.0.0
```

### Release Process

1. **Development**: Work normally, build script warns of any version issues
2. **Release**: Use `just release TYPE` for automated version bump and tagging
3. **Publishing**: `git push origin main --tags`

The build script automatically detects version mismatches and provides helpful warnings during development.

## Building and Running

```bash
# Quick development commands
just build              # Build the project
just test               # Run tests
just check              # Run all checks (fmt, lint, test)
just version            # Show version info

# Traditional cargo commands
cargo build
cargo run -- version
cargo test
cargo build --release

# Run with a ROM file (when implemented)
just run path/to/rom.ch8
cargo run -- run path/to/rom.ch8
```

## Development Setup

```bash
# Install development tools
just dev-setup

# Check project status
just status

# Common development cycle
just check              # Before committing
just build && just test # Verify everything works
```

## Contributing

This is primarily a learning project, but suggestions and improvements are welcome!

### Development Tools Used
